	<h1> Basic Javascript Syntax </h1>
	<br>
	<h3>JavaScript Syntax</h3>
	<br>
	<p>Javascript (or JavaScript) is a programming laguage. It's syntax has much in common with other major programming laguages. Simply learnig Javascript will make learning additional programming laguages significantly easier. 
		<br>
		Before we go any further, please understand that Javascript is <strong>Not</strong> the same as Java. They are different programming laguages and have nothing to do with each other. 
		<br>
		Java is <strong>Not</strong> short for Javascript. It's a very common misconception made by code noobz. You are not a code noob.</p>

		<br> 

		<h3>STATEMENTS</h3>

		<br>

		<p>Computer programs are created by programming languages, life Javascript, and are given specific instructions to preform. Programming laguages give computer programds instructions through <strong>Statements</strong>.</p>
		<br>
		<p> Statements are sepetated by semicolins, like so: <br> </p>

		<p><span class="code">	var funMessage = "Hello!"<span class="yellow">;</span></span> <br>
		<span class="code"> window.alert(funMessage)<span class="yellow">;</span></span></p>

		<br>


		<p> Statements in JavaScript havefive separate elements:</p>

		<br>

		<ol>
			<li> Values</li>
			<li> Keywords</li>
			<li> Expressions</li>
			<li> Operators</li>
			<li> Comments</li>
		</ol>

		<br>

		<h3 class="yellow">VALUES</h3>

		<br>

		<p>There are two types of values in Javascript:
			<br>
			<strong>Fixed</strong>
			<br>
			<strong>Variable</strong>
		</p>

		<br>

		<h3>LITERALS</h3>

		<br>

		<p><strong>Fixed Values</strong> (a.k.a Literals)
			<br>
			Think of these values as somthing that doesn't change. Ever.
			<br>
			Because it's been <strong>"hard coded"</strong>.
		</p>
		
		<p><strong>Numbers</strong> such as <span class="code"> 17.425 or 946 </span>
			<br>
			<strong>Strings</strong>
			are simply text, written in <span class="code"> 'single'</span> or <span class="code">"doble quotes"</span>
			<br>
			<strong>Expressions </strong> compute to values, like math: <span class="code">10* 4 or 3.14 - 6</span>
		</p>

		<br>

		<h3>VARIABLES</h3>

		<br>

		<p>
			<strong>Variable Values</strong> (a.k.a Variables)
			<br>
			Variables are different form literals because the value can change. Varibles are used to store data, such as numbers,
			strings, or expressions. Think of a variable as a <strong> bucket that can have stuff in it.</strong>
			<br>
			Javascript uses the <strong>keyword</strong> <span class="yellow code">  var </span> to define a variable, then uses <span class="yellow code">=</span> to assing a value to the variable.
			<br>
			<span class="code">var <span class="yellow"> myVariable;</span></span>
			<br>
			<span class="code"><span class="yellow">myVariable =</span> 2 * 4;</span>
		</p>

		<br>

		<h3 class="yellow"> OPERATORS</h3>

		<br>

		<p>
			IN javascript, and many other programming laguages, there are many different types of operators. Two of the most common operators are:
			<br>
			<strong>Arithmetic Operators</strong>
			<br>
			<strong>Assignment Operators</strong>
		</p>

		<br>

		<h3>Arithmetic</h3>

		<br>

		<p>Arithmetic operators are used for math! Here are some of the most common arithmetic operators:</p>

		<br>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Operator</th>
				<th>Description</th>
				<th>Example</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>+</td>
				<td>Addition</td>
				<td>var a = 1 + 2;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>-</td>
				<td>Subtraction</td>
				<td>var b = 10 - 8;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>*</td>
				<td>Multiplication</td>
				<td>var c = a * b;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>/</td>
				<td>Division</td>
				<td>var d = 100 / c;</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<br>

		<h3>ASSINGMENTS</h3>

		<br>

		<p>Assingment operators are used to <strong>assign</strong> values to variables.</p>

		<br>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Operator</th>
				<th>Example</th>
				<th>Is the same as</th>
				<th>What it dose</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>=</td>
				<td>a = b</td>
				<td>a = b</td>
				<td> Assigns a vilue to a variable</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>+=</td>
				<td>a += b</td>
				<td>a = a + b</td>
				<td>Adds a value to a variable</td>
			</tr>
			</tr>
				<td>-=</td>
				<td>a -= b</td>
				<td>a = a - b</td>
				<td>Subtracts a value to a variable</td>
			</tr>
			</tr>
				<td>*=</td>
				<td>a *= b</td>
				<td>a = a * b</td>
				<td>Multiplies a value to a variable</td>
			</tr>
			</tr>
				<td>/=</td>
				<td>a /= b</td>
				<td>a = a / b</td>
				<td>Divides a value to a variable</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<br>

		<h2>Statements</h2>

		<br>

		<h3 class="yellow">COMMENTS</h3>

		<br>

		<p>
			You can <i>hide</i> statements from the computer program using comments, so the statements do not execute. There are two types of comments in Javascript:
			<br>

			<span class="yellow code">// Single line comments 
			
			<br>
			<div id="multiLine" class="code">
				/*  Multi line comments
				    that can take up 
					as many lines 
					as you want */
			</div>
			</span>
			
		</p>

		<br>

		<h3>Case Sensitive</h3>

		<br>

		<p>
			Javascirpt is a case sensitive, meaning that the following variables are entirely different:
			<br>
			<span class="yellow code"> yourName = Tim Apple;
				<br>
			yourname = Tim Cook;</span>

			<br>

			That means that <strong>keyword</strong> <span class="yellow code">var</span> must always be typed in lowercase.
		</p>


		<h1><span id="end" class="yellow code"> end();</span></h1>
